# Interview Assistant: A Facial Emotion Detection Project

## Description
The project focuses on making a facial emotion detection interview assistant that keeps track of the person in scope's attention

## Motivation 
We can identify what the person is trying to convey by looking at their facial expressions. As they say, "a picture is worth a thousand." A conversation is 5% verbal and 95% non-verbal, and in an attempt to try to help machine understand what we do, we try to teach it the concept of "emotion" by training it on facial emotion datasets.

## Impact
This project will help a student to guide them to enhance their interview skills and a company to judge the performance of an interviewee.
